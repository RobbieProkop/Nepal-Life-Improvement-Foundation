              <h3>Establisment of Pachabhaiya Community Development Centre</h3>
              <p>
                This will be used to host a variety of educational and skill development workshops and programs. Management and Program coordination is on a volunteer basis, however we will provide income for local labour and workshop instructors.

              <p>
                We have been able to help people with urgent medical and dental problems, including life saving treatment for a 2 year old boy with a serious kidney ailment. Without access to Government supported healthcare, many Nepali people cannot afford proper medical care.

            <h3>COVID-19 Food Drive</h3>
            <p>
              During the lockdown people were unable to work resulting in basic food shortages. We bought a ton of rice, a half ton of lentils and 300 liters of cooking oil and distributed it through the village with the help of our local partners, which was enough to provide many families over 2 months of basic food security until the local rice and lentil harvest.

            <p>
              We have been able to fund new construction and necessary home repairs on several houses in the village affected by the earthquake and severe monsoon damage. We have replaced roofs, built new kitchens and renovated living spaces to strengthen walls and foundations.

            <h3>Window Installation</h3>
            <p>
              A local family was enduring the monsoon seasons, year after year, without any protection from the elements. Insects, weather, and snakes were a constant threat to this family's safety. We purchased and installed new windows. They are now safe, dry and happy.
